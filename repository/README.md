Data repo PHP script
--------------------

Simple place this script on web server and start using it as repo for plugins. If you want automatic updates, then put server's address and port to `trusted.sites` file in your **PexelMaster** storage folder as a new line.

Folder structure must follow this rules: <https://github.com/dobrakmato/pexel-platform/wiki/Directory-structure>.
You don't need to have `index.xml` indexes in folders.

Note to map naming: Try to keep map naming in this convention `sg_desert`, where `sg` is two or three letter name of minigame and `desert` is name of the map.
